# ðŸ”Œ Product Taxonomy Classifier

> **ðŸ”’ Disclaimer**
> This is a simplified public version and does not reflect the full internal deployment used at Loeb Electric.

At **Loeb Electric**, we rely on third-party product content syndication services to enrich and categorize our product data. However, some products â€” particularly wires and related electrical components â€” return with no matches. This tool addresses that gap.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

- Incomplete product classification from syndication services
- Manual categorization is slow, inconsistent, and labor-intensive
- Internal analytics and e-commerce workflows require accurate product taxonomy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Build a supervised machine learning system to classify electrical products into a **4-level hierarchy**, using structured and unstructured text fields like descriptions, product family, keywords, etc.

### Category Levels
| Level | Description    | Example                       |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1     | Type           | Wire, Cable, Conduit          |
| 2     | Use Case       | Building, Welding, Control    |
| 3     | Attributes     | THHN, XHHW, Armored, Tray     |
| 4     | Specs          | 12 AWG, Copper, 500ft, Spool  |

## ðŸ§± Modular Pipeline Overview

The project is structured into clearly defined modules:

- `text_pipeline.py` â€” Load and preprocess text fields
- `model_training.py` â€” Train logistic regression models using different field weights
- `analysis_text_weight.py` â€” Analyze and visualize how description weighting affects performance
- `analysis_hierarchy.py` â€” Evaluate and visualize prediction accuracy across hierarchy levels
- `export_results.py` â€” Export final predictions with confidence and true labels
- `main.py` â€” Pipeline entry point: coordinates everything

---

## ðŸ“Š Visual Outputs

The project includes:
- Metric comparison by weight (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Training vs validation class distribution
- Scatter plot of predicted vs actual class indices
- Hierarchy-level confidence analysis and accuracy heatmaps

---

## ðŸ“‚ Key Input Files

- `data/training_set.csv` â€” Labeled training samples
- `data/validation_set.csv` â€” Labeled validation set
- `data/taxonomy.csv` â€” Mapping of class labels to 4-level hierarchy

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo and set up a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the main pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Outputs will be saved to `data/prediction_set.csv` and visualizations will display inline.
